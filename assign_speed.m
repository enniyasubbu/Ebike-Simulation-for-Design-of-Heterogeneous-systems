function track_data = assign_speed(gpx_data)
%ASSIGNSPEED assigns a driving speed to each track point.
% ROUTE = ASSIGNSPEED(TRACK_DATA) extends the gpx data by adding columns
% for velocity, time and acceleration.
%
% GPX_DATA  is a Nx8 array where each row is a track point.
%   Columns 1-3 are the X, Y, and Z coordinates.
%   Columns 4-5 are latitude and longitude
%   Column  6 is the distance between the track point and its predecessor
%   Column  7 is the cumulative track length
%   Column  8 is the slope between the track point and its predecessor.
